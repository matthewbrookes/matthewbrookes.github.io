I have been working as a Software Engineer/Developer at Optiver Europe since
September 2020. At Optiver I work on building auto-traders and applications
to assist the market makers performing screen trading. Before joining
Optiver, I worked as a Backend Engineer at both Monzo and Skyscanner.

As well as developing software I enjoy taking a more holistic interest in my
role. At Monzo this meant that I was heavily involved in the complicance and
strategy side of growing an emerging lending business.

I completed my MEng Computing degree at Imperial College London and ETH
Zürich. I participated in an exchange program to ETH Zürich where I wrote my
[Master's Thesis](https://doi.org/10.3929/ethz-b-000362324) within the
[Systems Group](https://www.systems.ethz.ch/).

I enjoy systems programming in Rust, Go and Java. Since joining Optiver I
have also begun developing systems in C++. My frontend development experience
mostly involves React JS and CoffeeScript. I have also previously written
Android applications.
