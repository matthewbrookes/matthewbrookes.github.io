Hi, welcome to my new blog! I'm hoping to use this as a place to explain projects I'm working on and other things that interest me. I expect I'll only post from time to time but hopefully something I post will be picked up by someone.

Right now I'm about two months from completing my Master's Thesis so I'll probably write about that once I've finished. I've learnt some interesting things along the way and it'll be nice to share some of those.
