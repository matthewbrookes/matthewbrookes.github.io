Today I presented the demo paper "FASTER State Management for Timely Dataflow" at the [BIRTE workshop](https://birte-conf.github.io/birte2019/index.html) co-located with [VLDB](http://www.vldb.org/2019/). This is the result of joint work with my supervisors for my Master's thesis: [Vasiliki Kalavri](http://people.inf.ethz.ch/kalavriv/) and [John Liagouris](http://people.inf.ethz.ch/ioannisl/). You can check out the paper [here](http://matthewbrook.es/assets/BIRTE_2019_FASTER_State_Management_for_Timely_Dataflow.pdf).

I also attended many interesting talks at VLDB. My personal highlights being the following:
* Megaphone: Latency-conscious state migration for distributed streaming dataflows
* SLOG: Serializable, Low-latency, Geo-replicated Transactions
* An Experimental Evaluation of Garbage Collectors on Big Data Applications
