MEng Computing student at Imperial College London.
Currently participating in an exchange program to ETH ZÃ¼rich
where I am writing my Master's Thesis with the [Systems Group](https://www.systems.ethz.ch/).

My interests are in Distributed Systems and Large-Scale Data Intensive Applications.
The focus of my Master's Thesis is State Management for Distributed Streaming Applications.

After completing my degree I will be joining [Monzo](https://monzo.com/) as a Backend Engineer ðŸš€.

I enjoy systems programming in Rust, Go and Java.
My frontend development experience mostly involves React JS.
I have also previously written Android applications.
